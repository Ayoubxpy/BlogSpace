# Blog Space Project

`Blog Space` is a simple web application that allows you to view blog posts from an API and submit your own. This project was built as a practical exercise to apply concepts related to fetching and posting data using the `fetch()` API in JavaScript.

## What I Learned

This project was a great opportunity to put several key API and web development concepts into practice:

-   **HTTP Requests:**
    -   **URLs, endpoints:** Interacting with specific API endpoints to get and post data.
    -   **Methods:** Using `GET` to retrieve data and `POST` to send new data.
    -   **Body:** Structuring the data payload to be sent in the request body.
    -   **Headers:** Specifying the `Content-Type` to ensure the API correctly processes the request.
-   **REST APIs:**
    -   **Resources:** Understanding how to interact with a 'posts' resource.
    -   **Parameters & Queries:** Understanding how to structure API requests.
-   **JavaScript `fetch()` API:** Making asynchronous requests to a third-party API to get and send data.
-   **DOM Manipulation:** Dynamically rendering the list of blog posts on the page.
